**Date:** May 22, 2025

---

## üìñ Overview
### ‚öôÔ∏è Robot Dynamics

A foundation in motion modeling for physical systems:

- From kinematics to dynamics: modeling beyond geometry.
- Newton-Euler formalism for rigid-body motion.
- Templates across various platforms: quadrotors, fixed-wing aircraft, ground vehicles.

These tools frame how robots perceive, predict, and act in the physical world.
