## 📖 Overview

### 🎛️ Control Systems

We introduce the structure and intent of control in robotics:

- Hierarchies of control: from strategic planning to real-time actuation.
- Anatomy of a control loop: sensing, decision, and execution.
- Where control matters: trajectory tracking, stabilization, interaction, and many more!

### ⚙️ Robot Dynamics

A foundation in motion modeling for physical systems:

- From kinematics to dynamics: modeling beyond geometry.
- Newton-Euler formalism for rigid-body motion.
- Templates across various platforms: quadrotors, fixed-wing aircraft, ground vehicles.

These tools frame how robots perceive, predict, and act in the physical world.
