## ðŸ“– Overview

Todayâ€™s session was an exploration of how geometry meets learning, diving into representations, processing techniques, and modern neural approaches in **3D vision**.

We began by breaking down the core 3D representations used across research and industry:

* **Point Clouds** for their lightweight, unordered nature.
* **Voxels** as volumetric grids that bridge 2D and 3D intuitions.
* **Meshes** to model surface geometry and topology.
* And the rising trend of **implicit representations**, which bypass discrete geometry altogether by learning continuous functions.


Next, we explored **deep learning** methods tailored to these representations:

* **VoxNet** introduced us to applying CNNs on voxel grids.
* **PointNet** and **PointNet++** revealed how to learn directly from raw point clouds, with increasing locality.
* We wrapped up with **DGCNN**, which brings in dynamic graph structures to model point relationships more richly.

To go deeper into the geometric side, we covered **point cloud processing techniques** â€” essential for preparing data and improving learning robustness:

* **Poisson Disk Sampling** for uniform sub-sampling without clumping.
* **Farthest Point Sampling (FPS)** as a greedy but effective strategy for downsampling with maximal coverage.
* And a few other tricks of the trade to make point clouds more learnable.

Finally, we zoomed out to **novel view synthesis** representations with **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)**, a breakthrough in 3D scene reconstruction using implicit volumetric rendering that synthesizes novel views with remarkable photorealism. We wrapped up by introducing **3D Gaussian Splatting**, a fast and efficient alternative that models scenes with **ellipsoid-based representations**, enabling real-time rendering with high visual fidelity.

All in all, the session connected the dots from classical geometric representations to the neural pipelines that now define modern 3D vision.
