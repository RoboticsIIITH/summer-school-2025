## ðŸ“– Overview

This lecture introduced coordinate systems and transformations, emphasizing how these concepts underpin robotics, graphics, and simulation. We covered 2D and 3D transformations using matrices, homogeneous coordinates, and rotation representations including Euler angles and quaternions. The session highlighted how different systems interact and how transformations compose in space.

## ðŸ§  Notes

Understanding transformations is central to nearly all of robotics. Quaternions, though abstract, offer elegant solutions to 3D rotation problems â€” without the pitfalls of gimbal lock. If you're wondering what *The Matrix*, *Tomb Raider*, quantum mechanics, and spacecraft landings have in common... the answer lies in 19th century graffiti â€” the invention of quaternions.

Review the slides, try the assignment early, and explore the misc. links if you want a deeper appreciation for the beauty and legacy of spatial math.
