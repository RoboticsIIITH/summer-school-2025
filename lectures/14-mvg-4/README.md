# Lecture 14: Multi-View Geometry - IV

## ðŸ“– Overview

We started off with a description of the **Structure from Motion (SfM)** task, and how **Bundle Adjustment** serves as the optimization method to solve this problem. We then moved into a detailed breakdown of the task â€” what parameters are involved and how the loss function is formulated.

Next, we discussed the issues with using a **Homogeneous Coordinate System**, particularly the ambiguity introduced by scale. We then saw how moving to the **Euclidean Coordinate System** helps resolve this by eliminating scale parameters.

We briefly touched upon **Lie Algebra** â€” a mathematical framework for 3D transformations that is especially useful for optimization of transformation matrices. Further reading resources have been provided for those interested.

We also explored open-source pipelines for tackling this task:  
- **COLMAP** for solving the core `SfM` pipeline, and  
- **HLoc** as an application layer for relocalization from arbitrary images using a pre-computed `SfM` map.

Finally, we wrapped up by looking at some **deep learning-based approaches** to 3D reconstruction â€” **DUSt3R** and **MASt3R** â€” discussing the differences between the two, and how they can be used for both `Reconstruction` and `Re-localization`.

## ðŸ“„ Assignments

1. ðŸ“˜ **COLMAP & HLoc Walkthrough:**  
   Open the following notebook for a guided exercise on classical structure-from-motion and local feature-based localization:  
   [![Jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20Notebook-sfm--colmap--hloc.ipynb-orange?logo=jupyter)](./sfm-colmap-hloc.ipynb)

   - Run COLMAP on the *South Building* dataset to generate a sparse 3D model. Try exporting the outputs (`images.txt`, `points3D.txt`, `cameras.txt`).
   - Follow the instructions for HLoc to try out local feature-based localization on the *Sacre Coeur* dataset.

2. ðŸš€ **MASt3R-based Map-Free Visual Localization Pipeline:**  
   Set up [**MASt3R**](https://github.com/naver/mast3r) and build a simple map-free visual localization system using your own data.

   **Steps:**
   - **Data Collection**: Use a dataset or collect data using tools like [MARS Logger](https://github.com/OSUPCVLab/mobile-ar-sensor-logger). Create two runs:  
     - A **reference run** (serving as the map).  
     - A **query run** (frames to localize).
   - **Image Retrieval**: For each query frame, retrieve top matching reference frames using [HLoc](https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization).  
     (Tip: `CosPlace` works well for indoor scenes.)
   - **Feature Matching**: Run matching between retrieved reference and query frames.
   - **3D Lifting**: Project the matched keypoints in the reference images into 3D using MASt3Râ€™s predicted depth/pointmap.
   - **Pose Estimation**: Use the 2D-3D matches to estimate pose using **PnP**.
   - **Evaluation**: Plot the estimated query trajectory and compare it to ground truth using [`evo`](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo).
   - **Bonus / Studies**  
  What other options are available for image retrieval â€” can the features from **MASt3R** itself be repurposed for this task? For relative pose estimation, could one use the **Essential Matrix** instead of PnP, and under what conditions would it be preferable? Evaluate how well MASt3R estimates depth maps: how does it compare to sensor-based depths? You could also try using [**UniDepthV2**](https://github.com/lpiccinelli-eth/UniDepth) or [**Metric3Dv2**](https://github.com/YvanYin/Metric3D) to estimate depth and compare their predictions with MASt3R's outputs.
